# Maintenance weekend x 3

The vendor for the application that we support at work, has scheduled maintenance for the next three weekends. ☹️  I do the checks to make sure that the application Single Sign-on and the database are working as expected after the maintenance.  On average the maintenance starts Friday at 8:00 PM and completes at 4:00 AM the following day, that is the schedule.  But at times the maintenance completes early, which means I have to be on my toes during the scheduled maintenance to do testing when the maintenance completes.  The bad and good of the following two maintainences, threre are two. 😜
